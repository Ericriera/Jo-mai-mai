This is a fun mobile application built with [Expo](https://expo.dev/) and React Native, based on the popular game "Never Have I Ever". The app is designed to be played in a group setting, encouraging players to share experiences in a lighthearted way. The app is designed to be cross-platform and works on both iOS and Android devices and on [web](https://jomaimai.netlify.app/) (recomended to play on mobile devices).
